## Overview

Managing parking space or finding a parking spot in nowadays congested cities could be a real challenge.  
The aim of this project is therefore to provide an efficient parking management application for all the actors involved in such a topic, that means municipalities, policemen and of course drivers.  
This project was developed for the laboratory part of the [Software Project Management](http://didattica.cs.unicam.it/doku.php?id=didattica:magistrale:spm:ay_2021:main) course, held by Prof. [Andrea Polini](http://docenti.unicam.it/pdett.aspx?ids=N&tv=d&UteId=626&ru=RD) and Prof. [Fabrizio Fornari](https://docenti.unicam.it/pdett.aspx?ids=N&tv=d&UteId=1179&ru=PROFCONTR) at the [University of Camerino](http://www.unicam.it/).   
This application was developed as a Maven project adopting some of the most common DevOps technologies and Scrum principles and rules.    
It is suited for 3 kinds of users: municipalities, drivers and policemen.
